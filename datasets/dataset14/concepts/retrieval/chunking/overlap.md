# Overlap

> Concepts > Retrieval > Chunking > Overlap.Md

## Overview

This section covers overlap in the context of vector databases.
Understanding this concept is essential for building effective
document search and retrieval systems.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have:
- Completed the [Getting Started](../getting-started/installation.md) guide
- Basic understanding of vector databases
- Access to the development environment

## Details

### Key Concepts

Overlap involves several important considerations:

1. **Performance**: Optimize for both latency and throughput
2. **Accuracy**: Ensure high precision and recall in results
3. **Scalability**: Design for growing document collections
4. **Maintainability**: Keep the configuration simple and well-documented

### Configuration

```yaml
overlap:
  enabled: true
  strategy: "default"
  options:
    batch_size: 32
    timeout: 30
    retry_count: 3
```

### Code Example

```python
from platform import overlap

# Initialize the component
component = overlap.create(config)

# Process documents
results = component.process(documents)
print(f"Processed {len(results)} documents")
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Slow processing | Large batch size | Reduce `batch_size` to 16 |
| Memory errors | Too many documents | Enable streaming mode |
| Poor quality | Wrong model | Try a different vector databases model |
